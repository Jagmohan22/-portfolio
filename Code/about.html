              <p>
                  I am a second-year BCA student at UPES Dehradun, passionate about technology, programming, and problem-solving. 
                  I completed my 10th and 12th from Kendriya Vidyalaya Gauchar, where I built a strong foundation in logic and analytical thinking.
              </p>
              <p>
                  From an early age, I was drawn to computers and software development, which led me to explore various technologies and sharpen my coding skills. 
                  I aim to become a skilled software engineer, capable of building impactful solutions.
